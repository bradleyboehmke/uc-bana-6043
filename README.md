UC BANA 6043 Statistical Computing
================

This repository contains additional resources for the UC BANA 6043 Statistical Computing course. The following is a truncated syllabus; for the full syllabus along with complete course content please visit the online course content in [Canvas](https://uc.instructure.com/). 


## Course Description

Welcome to Statistical Computing with Python! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to statistical computing and data science with the Python programming language. You will gain foundational skills in managing data structures, performing data wrangling, computing and visualizing statistical relationships, managing various environments conducive for statistical analysis, and performing machine learning modeling. Most importantly, since this course only has time to introduce foundational skills, much emphasis is placed on giving you a mental model of Python's data science ecosystem so you know how, when, and where to continue advancing your statistical computing capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will:

* Have a mental model of the Python data science ecosystem: libraries, capabilities, vocabulary, and widely-available Python resources.
* Have the ability to use Python within both interactive (Jupyter, REPL) and non-interactive (scripts) environments.
* Be able to perform core data wrangling activities: importing data, reshaping data, transforming data, and exporting data.
* Be able to compute descriptive statistics and visualize key patterns and relationships with your data.
* Be exposed to modeling via scikit-learn and discuss the fundamentals of building models in Python.
* Have the resources and understanding to continue advancing your statistical computing capabilities.
