# Overview

In the last module we discussed general guidelines for importing data and how to perform basic tasks with Series and DataFrames. In module 3 we want to build on those activities by learning how to perform common data wrangling tasks. This includes select subsets of data, manipulating columns, and computing summary statistics.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Create subsets of our data by selecting columns and filtering rows of interest.
- Manipulate, create, drop, even identify missing value patterns across our DataFrameâ€™s columns.
- Compute various aggregations with Pandas Series and DataFrames.
