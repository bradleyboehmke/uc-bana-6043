    "\n",
    "Dealing with character strings is often under-emphasized in data analysis training. The focus typically remains on numeric values; however, the growth in data collection is also resulting in greater bits of information embedded in text. Consequently, handling, cleaning and processing character strings is becoming a prerequisite in daily data analysis. This lesson is meant to give you the foundation of working with character strings.\n",

    "A regular expression (aka regex) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with text strings. Typically, regex patterns consist of a combination of alphanumeric characters as well as special characters. The pattern can also be as simple as a single character or it can be more complex and include several combinations of characters.\n",

    "To understand how to work with regular expressions in Python, we need to consider two primary features of regular expressions. One has to do with the syntax, or the way regex patterns are expressed in Python. The other has to do with the functions used for regex matching in Python. You will be exposed to both of these in the following sections."

    "\n",
    "Python’s standard library, and Pandas adoption of these string methods provides us a convenient approach to regular expressions. Many of the methods used in the previous sections can be used with regex. The common pattern for our method calls consist of:\n",

    "* `pattern` represents the regex pattern you are looking to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example let’s say you are looking for observations where the word “FRUIT” was used in the `product_category` description. As we saw earlier `.str.contains()` detects the presence or absence of a pattern (“FRUIT” in this example) and returns a boolean response. Since the output is TRUE or FALSE, this is a handy function to combine with indexing to filter for observations that have that pattern."
