# Overview

Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use various Python libraries to create meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned data visualizations. You will also learn to combine data transformation, manipulation, and visualization to explore your data and start extracting key insights.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Discuss the ecosystem of Python tools for visualization.
- Build meaning visualizations with Python.
- Identify which plots to use to explore different types of variables.
- Combine descriptive statistics and visualization to identify summaries, relationships, differences, and abnormalities in the data.
