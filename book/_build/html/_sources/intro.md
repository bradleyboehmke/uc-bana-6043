# Machine Learning with Python

This is my own personal Machine Learning with Python book, which contains implementations of commonly used machine learning tasks to include:

* Algorithms
   - Generalized low rank models
   - Clustering algorithms
   - Autoencoders
   - Regularized models
   - Random forests
   - Gradient boosting machines
   - Deep neural networks
   - Stacking / super learners
   - and more!
* Model experimentation & management
* Model deployment & production scoring
* TBD
