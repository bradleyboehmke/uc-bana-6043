# Overview

Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use various Python libraries to create meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned data visualizations. You will also learn to combine data transformation, manipulation, and visualization to explore your data and start extracting key insights.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Discuss the ecosystem of Python tools for visualization.
- Build meaningful visualizations with Python.
- Apply both higher and lower level Python visualization libraries to your data.
