# ## Optional supplemental material
# 
# There are introductory Python concepts that this class does not cover, like classes and object-oriented programming, which you may find useful in your foray into data analysis with Python.
# 
# To deepen your Python language knowledge, I recommend that you supplement this book with the [official Python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/) and potentially one of the many excellent books on general-purpose Python programming. Some recommendations to get you started include:
