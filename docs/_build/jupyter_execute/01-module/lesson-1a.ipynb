    "Before diving into the Python interpreter, I pause here to remind you that this class is not meant to teach Python syntax (though you will learn plenty of that!). The things you learn here are meant to help you understand, and ultimately do, statistical computing more generally. Think of it this way: this class is meant to help you unleash the power of your computer on your statistical problems. Python is just the language of instruction. That said, let's start talking about how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted language**, which means that each line of code you write is translated, or *interpreted*, into a set of instructions that your machine can understand by the **Python interpreter**. This stands in contrast to **compiled languages**.  For these languages (the dominant ones being Fortran, C, and C++), your entire code is translated into machine language before you ever run it. When you execute your program, it is already in machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever you want your Python code to run, you give it to the Python interpreter.\n",

    "So, Jupyter is an extension of IPython that pushes interactive computing further. It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a new language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (another dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you can run over 40 different languages in a JupyterLab, not just Julia, Python, and R.\n",

You can always import those modules when you are using a Jupyter notebook (more on modules and importing them later in the class). Consequently, a Jupyter notebook is often not optimal for an application where you are building reusable code or scripts or productionizing code. However, Jupyter notebooks are **very** useful in the following applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Exploratory data analysis.* Jupyter notebooks are great for trying things out with code, or exploring a data set. This is an important part of the research process. The layout of Jupyter notebooks is great for organizing thoughts as you synthesize them.\n",
    "2. *Developing visualizations.* This is really just a special case of (1), but is worth mentioning separately because Jupyter notebooks are especially useful when interactively visualizing data. Using the Jupyter notebook, you can write down what you hope to accomplish in each step of processing and then graphically show the results with plots as you go through the analysis. We will do this later in the class.\n",
    "3. *Sharing your thinking in your analysis.* Because you can combine nicely formatted text and executable code, Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing how you go about doing your calculations with collaborators and with readers of your publications.\n",
    "4. *Pedagogy.* All of the content in this class, including this lesson, was developed using Jupyter notebooks! You will find lots of educational content online that is developed and hosted directly in Jupyter notebooks.\n",

The watermark package is an **[IPython magic extension](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/index.html)**. These extensions allow convenient functionality within IPython or Jupyter notebooks. In general, to use magic functions, you precede them with a `%` sign or a `%%` in a cell. We use the built-in `%load_ext` magic function to load watermark, and then we use `%watermark` to invoke it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `-v` flag to ask watermark to give us the Python and IPython verison numbers and the `-p` flag to give us version numbers on specified packages we've used. We can also use a `-m` flag to give information about the machine running the notebook, and you should do that, but I will not do that for the class to avoid clutter."
