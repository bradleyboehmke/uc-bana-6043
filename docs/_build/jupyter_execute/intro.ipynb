    "Welcome to ___Statistical Computing with Python___! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to statistical computing and data science with the Python programming language. You will gain foundational skills in managing data structures, performing data wrangling, computing and visualizing statistical relationships, managing various environments conducive for statistical analysis, and performing machine learning modeling. Most importantly, since this course only has time to introduce foundational skills, much emphasis is placed on giving you a mental model of Python's data science ecosystem so you know how, when, and where to continue advancing your statistical computing capabilities."

    "Upon successfully completing this course, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a mental model of the Python data science ecosystem: libraries, capabilities, vocabulary, and widely-available Python resources.\n",
    "* Have the ability to use Python within both interactive (Jupyter, REPL) and non-interactive (scripts) environments.\n",
    "* Be able to perform core data wrangling activities: importing data, reshaping data, transforming data, and exporting data.\n",
    "* Be able to compute descriptive statistics and visualize key patterns and relationships with your data.\n",
    "* Be exposed to modeling via scikit-learn and discuss the fundamentals of building models in Python.\n",
    "* Have the resources and understanding to continue advancing your statistical computing capabilities.\n",

    "__Modules__: For this class each module is covered over the course of week. In the \"Overview\" section for each module you will find overall learning objectives, a short description of the learning content covered in that module, along with all tasks that are required of you for that module (i.e. quizzes, lab). Each module will have two or more primary lessons and associated quizzes along with a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lessons__: For each lesson you will read and work through the tutorial. Short videos will be sprinkled throughout the lesson to further discuss and reinforce lesson concepts. Each lesson will have various \"Your Turn\" exercises throughout, along with end-of-lesson exercises. I highly recommend you work through these exercises as they will prepare you for the quizzes, labs, and project work.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Quizzes__: There will be a short quiz associated with _each lesson_. These quizzes will be hosted in the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these quizzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Labs__: There will be a lab associated with _each module_. For these labs students will be guided through a case study step-by-step. The aim is to provide a detailed view on how to manage a variety of complex real-world data; how to convert real problems into data wrangling and analysis problems; and to apply Python to address these problems and extract insights from the data. Submission of these labs will be done through the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Project__: The final project is designed for you to put to work the tools and knowledge that you gain throughout this course. This provides you with multiple benefits. \n",
    "   - It will provide you with more experience using data science tools on real life data sets.\n",
    "   - It helps you become a self-directed learner. As a data scientist, a large part of your job is to self-direct your learning and interests to find unique and creative ways to find insights in data.\n",
    "   - It starts to build your data science portfolio. Establishing a data science portfolio is a great way to show potential employers your ability to work with data."
