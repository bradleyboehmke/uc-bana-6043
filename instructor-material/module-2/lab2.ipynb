    "INTRODUCE YOURSELF! Using a Jupyter notebook with Markdown, create an HTML report that provides me with background information about you. Here is an [old example introduction to me](https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/datawrangling_week1_homework) that you can base your outline on (disregard the homework problems at the bottom). You do not need to follow this outline exactly; however, this provides the fundamental output I am looking for. I do expect you to include an image so I know who you are! Be sure to use headings appropriately and feel free to incorporate features such as italics, bold font, lists, and HTML links. If you want to get saucy, show me you can write an equation, create a table, or embed a video; however, these are not required.\n",

    "* Academic Background\n",
    "* Professional Background\n",
