    "For this part of the lab we’ll work through the mbta.xlsx data. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) manages America’s oldest subway, as well as Greater Boston’s commuter rail, ferry, and bus systems. It’s your first day on the job as the T’s data analyst and you’ve been tasked with analyzing average ridership through time. Complete the following data cleaning tasks.\n",

    "3\\. It appears that the data are organized with observations stored as columns rather than as rows. You can fix that. First, though, you can address the missing data. All of the NA values are stored in the first row. This row really belongs in a different data frame; it is a quarterly average of weekday MBTA ridership. Since this data set tracks monthly average ridership, you’ll remove that row. Similarly, the 7th row (Pct Chg / Yr) and the 11th row (TOTAL) are not really observations as much as they are analysis. Go ahead and remove the 7th and 11th rows as well. After removing the first, seventh, and eleventh rows, what are the dimensions of the new DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. In this data, variables are stored in rows instead of columns. The different modes of transportation (commuter rail, bus, subway, boat, ...) are variables, providing information about each month’s average ridership. The months themselves are observations (Currently, months are listed as variable names; rather, they should be in their own column). You can tell which is which because as you go through time, the month changes, but the modes of transport offered by the T do not. As is customary, you want to represent variables in columns rather than rows.\n",

    "  \n",
    "5\\. Your data set is already looking much better! Your boss saw what a great job you’re doing and now wants you to do an analysis of the T’s ridership during certain months across all years. Your data set has months in it, so that analysis will be a piece of cake. There’s only one small problem: if you want to look at ridership on the T during every January (for example), the month and year are together in the same column, which makes it a little tricky. You’ll need to separate the month column into distinct month and year columns to make life easier.\n",

Unless the Olympics were happening in Boston that month (they weren’t), this value is certainly an error. You can assume that whoever was entering the data that month accidentally typed 40 instead of 4.\n",
